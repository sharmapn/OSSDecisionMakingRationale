This repository contains supplementary data for two of our papers focusing on rationale extraction from OSS email archives. 
It was initially created for our International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE) 2021 conference paper
``Extracting Rationale for Open Source Software Development Decisions â€” A Study of Python Email Archives''
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.05232.pdf

However, these data and images are also necessary supplemntary materials for our substantially revised version of the above paper which was published as a Journal paper "How are decisions made in Open Source Software communities?  --- Uncovering rationale from Python Email Repositories".
