This repository contains supplementary data for two of our papers focusing on rationale extraction from OSS email archives. 
It was initially created for our International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE) 2021 conference paper
``Extracting Rationale for Open Source Software Development Decisions â€” A Study of Python Email Archives''
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.05232.pdf

However, these supplementary materials are needed for the substantially revised article "How are decisions made in Open Source Software communities?  --- Uncovering rationale from Python Email Repositories" published in the Journal of Software: Evolution and Process.
