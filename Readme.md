This repository contains supplementary data for two of our papers focusing on rationale extraction from OSS email archives. 
It was initially created for our conference paper accepted at the International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE) 2021
``Extracting Rationale for Open Source Software Development Decisions â€” A Study of Python Email Archives''
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.05232.pdf

These supplementary materials are also needed for our substantially revised journal article "How are decisions made in Open Source Software communities?  --- Uncovering rationale from Python Email Repositories" published in the Journal of Software: Evolution and Process.
