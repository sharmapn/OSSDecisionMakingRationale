This repository contains supplementary data for two of our papers focusing on rationale extraction from OSS email archives. 
It was initially created for our ICSE 2021 conference paper
``Extracting Rationale for Open Source Software Development Decisions â€” A Study of Python Email Archives''
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.05232.pdf

Theereafter, a substantially revised version was published as a Journal paper "How are decisions made in Open Source Software communities?  --- Uncovering rationale from Python Email Repositories".
